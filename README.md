# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, GitHub!

My name is Mason, and I am very excited to learn all I can about this site. I recently graduated from college with a philosophy degree, but decided to pursue a career in software development! It's difficult to determine exactly how to start out, but I think this will be a great step. I only have limited experience with JavaScript, Python, and  Matlab right now, but I hope to expand my knowledge base quickly. If anyone actually happens to read this, any guidance or insight would be greatly appreciated!
